# Variational Mode Decomposition in C#
c# implementation of VMD

I created a vmd project by c#. This work is based on a python implemenation by @shenmusmart. I have created two version in this vmd project: one is based on accord.math whereas the other depends on numpy.net. Both libs can be obtained at NuGet in Visual Studio. BTW, remember run the project on x64 machine. The numpy.net works only on x64 architecture.
